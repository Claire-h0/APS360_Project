# APS360_Project
Final project for APS360 Deep Learning at the University of Toronto. Implements a deep learning model to colourize grayscale images using PyTorch on Google Colab.

The project focuses on automatically colourizing grayscale images using a deep learning model. We implemented a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a U-Net architecture for the generator and a PatchGAN discriminator. The model converts images to LAB color space, using the L channel (lightness) as input to predict the a and b channels (colour information). We trained it on a Kaggle dataset to learn relationships between grayscale patterns and realistic colour distributions.
